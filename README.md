Style Guides
============

As a growing organization with multiple new projects every semester, it is important to maintain good coding style so that projects will be maintainable and our code is reusable.

The guides are separated into several sections of related rules. For most rules the rationale is included; if not, it is assumed that the reason is clear enough.

Currently only the Rails style guide is written.

- [Rails](rails/README.md)
- [Django](django/README.md)
- [iOS](ios/README.md)
- [Android](android/README.md)

**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to our desire to see social good enacted in our community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
