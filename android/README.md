# Android Style Guide

Still a work in progress!

Basic Java styling from 61B (This class is the reason I documented the functions I wrote for ff): [Java Project Guide](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa13/labs/guidelines.pdf)

Google's official [Android Style Guide](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)

And another one we can look through! [Another pdf] (http://courses.coreservlets.com/Course-Materials/pdf/android/Android-Coding-Style.pdf)
